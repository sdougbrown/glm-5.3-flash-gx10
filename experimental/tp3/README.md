# TP=3 (three boxes)

GLM-5.3-Flash at tensor parallel 3. Four dimensions do not divide by 3, so
they are zero-padded; the padding is exact (zero heads and zero expert
columns add nothing) and the checkpoint on disk is not rewritten.

| | stock | padded | per rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| MLA heads | 64 | 66 | 22 |
| KDA heads | 64 | 66 | 22 |
| MoE intermediate | 2048 | 2304 | 768 |
| vocab | 154880 | 154944 | 51648 |
| DFlash2 drafter q / kv heads | 32 / 8 | 36 / 9 | 12 / 3 |

## Pieces

- `make_padded.py SRC_MODEL DST_MODEL SRC_DRAFT DST_DRAFT`: the target dir is
  hardlinks of every checkpoint file plus a `config.json` with the padded sizes
  and `tp_pad_orig`; the drafter (small) is padded offline. Run it inside the image.
- `tp3pad.py`: pads the target's tensors as `load_weights` reads them (hooked
  from `experimental/fixes/model.py`; a no-op when the config has no `tp_pad_orig`).
- `vocab_parallel_embedding.py`: pads the vocab on to a multiple of 64 x TP.
- `experimental/fixes/gb10_sparse_mla.py`: the Triton sparse-MLA kernel took
  `tl.arange(0, H)` over heads, which needs a power of two; 22 heads per rank
  now run in the next power-of-two tile with a head mask.
- `experimental/snapshot/dense_fp8.py`: the KDA in_proj at TP=3 has N=8726
  rows, not a multiple of 16, and stayed bf16; rows are now zero-padded to 16
  and the output trimmed.
- `image/entrypoint.sh`: a `TP=3` case. KV pin 12 GiB (26 GiB had the
  host OOM-killer take rank 0 during graph capture), block size 3456 (vLLM
  lifts it to 3584, 14% mamba page padding against 46% at the 4608 it picks
  from 2304).

## Running it

Everything else is the four-box setup from the main README (image, mentatd,
fabric), on three boxes.

1. **Padded model dirs, on every box.** The target dir is hardlinks, so it must
   sit on the same filesystem as the checkpoint; the drafter is copied and
   padded. Run inside the image this repo builds:

       docker run --rm -v /srv/models:/srv/models --entrypoint python3 \
         -v "$PWD/experimental/tp3":/tp3:ro spark-glm53:v9 /tp3/make_padded.py \
         /srv/models/glm-5.3-flash-nvfp4 /srv/models/glm-5.3-flash-nvfp4-tp3 \
         /srv/models/glm-5.3-flash-dflash2 /srv/models/glm-5.3-flash-dflash2-tp3

2. **compose/.env on every box** (tp3.yaml takes `TP` from the `.env`, defaulting
   to 3):

       MODEL_HOST_DIR=/srv/models/glm-5.3-flash-nvfp4-tp3
       DFLASH_HOST_DIR=/srv/models/glm-5.3-flash-dflash2-tp3

3. **Start** with every override, `recoverssm.yaml` included, and `tp3.yaml` last (it
   restates adaptive-k.yaml's `EXTRA_ARGS` and adds a data-parallel vision
   tower, whose 16 heads do not split by 3):

       ./glm53 -f experimental/compose/tp3.yaml up -d

   The first boot pads while it
   loads and writes a weight snapshot under its own tag (`tp3pad-...`, set in
   tp3.yaml; a TP=4 snapshot must never restore here); later boots restore it.

The entrypoint's `TP=3` case sets the KV pin (12 GiB), block size (3456),
`MAX_NUM_SEQS` 64 with RecoverSSM (32 without) and the adaptive-k starting cost. With RecoverSSM on, the head keeps ~6.6 GB of
host memory free while serving; a 16 GiB pin would leave ~2.6 GB, so do not raise it.

## Triangle, no switch (TP=RING3)

The same padded checkpoint on three GB10 boxes cabled as a triangle: each
box's two ConnectX-7 ports go to its two neighbours, one cable per port, and
the third box's port cables back to the first. No switch. Each cable is its
own `/24` — one address per box per cable, MTU 9000, on the first PCIe
root's netdevs of each port. Set `TP=RING3` in `compose/.env`; the
entrypoint maps it to its `TP=3` case (KV pin, block size, `MAX_NUM_SEQS`,
weight padding) and adds the ring wiring.

- **Compose overlays**: the TP=3 list above, with two changes — set
  `TP=RING3` in `compose/.env` (tp3.yaml now inherits it), and leave
  `experimental/compose/arx.yaml` out:

      docker compose -f compose/glm53.yaml \
        -f experimental/compose/snapshot.yaml \
        -f experimental/compose/adaptive-k.yaml -f experimental/compose/fp8.yaml \
        -f experimental/compose/megamoe.yaml -f experimental/compose/fixes.yaml \
        -f experimental/compose/sp.yaml -f experimental/compose/recoverssm.yaml \
        -f experimental/compose/tp3.yaml up -d

- **mentat**: 0.17.1 places ring claims of any size (a ring closes only at
  three members or more), so `MENTAT_CLAIM_LAYOUT=ring` needs no member
  count — the entrypoint sets it and the claim takes the three bundles of
  the TP=3 group. Tag the LAN interface `lan` and the first root's fabric
  netdevs `rdma` in `MENTAT_ANNOUNCE_IFACES` (step 4 of the main README):
  the second root's netdevs carry no IPv4, so they have nothing to announce
  and need no tag. Each rank gets its neighbours' addresses and the local
  interface toward each from mentat; `fabric_ring.py` turns those into the
  NCCL graph.

- **One device per port**: a device joins the fabric only when its netdev
  carries an IPv4 (its RoCE v2 GID then names that address, inside the
  cable's subnet), so the triangle runs on the first PCIe root only — one
  device per port, about half the two-root fabric bandwidth of the switched
  four-box setup. The second root's netdevs (`enP2p1s0f0np0`,
  `enP2p1s0f1np1`) sit unaddressed; put an address on one in its own subnet
  and `fabric_ring.py` picks it up with no further change, as on a switched
  fabric. The GID index differs per cable and moves on reboot, so ring mode
  never pins one index: NCCL finds each device's address GID itself.

- **arx**: off. arx's ring mode (`VLLM_ARX_RING`, set automatically for
  RING4) only supports groups of 2 or 4 ranks and raises for anything else;
  its mesh mode needs both roots on one shared GID index, which cables with
  their own subnets and differing indexes cannot give. So no `arx.yaml`
  above, the entrypoint exports `FABRIC_RING_ARX=0`, and `fabric_ring.py`
  does not export the arx ring variables for RING3.

Not measured yet: this section describes the wiring, and the numbers in
"Measured" below are all switched fabrics.

## Tried and not kept

At TP=3, on this stack, one change at a time against the defaults above:
sequence parallel off (-16% prefill), `VLLM_ARXBIG_AG=1` (-26 to -30%
prefill), `max_num_batched_tokens` 8192 (-4% at 22k), megamoe
`VLLM_MEGAMOE_MAX_TOKENS=16` and its tile variants (within noise), 72 MLA
heads instead of 66 (-10% prose decode, measured on the PR #4 base). A MoE intermediate of 2112 (704 per
rank) would pad less, but megamoe needs a multiple of 128 per rank.

## Tests

`dev/patch-tests/_glm53_tp3pad_test.py` (CPU) and
`dev/patch-tests/_glm53_tp3_sparse_mla_test.py` (one GB10); each file says how
to run it.

## Measured

Two sets of three boxes (one 200G switch, both ConnectX ports), each booted
clean with the defaults above (RecoverSSM on, `MAX_NUM_SEQS` 64), on this
branch over main 6db84d4 plus the capture-size fix from its own PR
(`tp-cudagraph-tiers`: an explicit capture cap dropped adaptive-k's decode
sizes 3, 5, 6, 10, 12 and 15). KV held 1.48M tokens then; with #16 the head log reports 1,905,585. On main 2288993 plus #20 and the zeroer fix, set 1 re-measured within noise: RigMark 43.9 / 76.2 / 113.7, cold prefill 8k / 32k / 64k 3312 / 3637 / 3587.

| | set 1 | set 2 |
|---|---|---|
| RigMark prose / code / structured, tok/s | 43.8 / 75.7 / 113.8 | 44.0 / 76.2 / 114.0 |
| RigMark cold prefill 8k / 32k / 64k, tok/s | 3295 / 3602 / 3565 | 3325 / 3610 / 3583 |
| `gate/prefill.py` cold 32k / 128k, tok/s (2 seeds) | 3574, 3533 / 3440, 3449 | 3561, 3554 / 3422, 3437 |
| `gate/conc_workload.py code` 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 streams, tok/s | 86.5 / 101.8 / 137.4 / 163.7 | 87.4 / 100.5 / 153.7 / 170.2 |
| `conc_workload.py mixed` 8 / 16 / 32 / 48 streams, tok/s | 134.1 / 195.5 / 262.7 / 335.9 | 141.0 / 200.3 / 260.0 / 333.9 |
| `dev/repro/needle.py` 32k to 480k | 12/12 | 12/12 |

At 48 streams, `MAX_NUM_SEQS` 64 gave +24% over 32 (269 tok/s); single-stream
decode is the same at both. A 30-minute soak of the same TP=3 changes on main
14cc721 (`MAX_NUM_SEQS` 32, 16 mixed streams back to back, 824 requests) had
no errors or restarts.

## TP=6 (six boxes)

The same padded checkpoint splits by 6: 11 MLA heads, 11 KDA heads and 384
MoE columns per rank. The pieces above cover it: the KDA in_proj has N=4491
per rank and takes the same row padding to 16, and the sparse-MLA kernel runs
11 heads in a 16-row tile. Only the drafter needs a different pad: its 8 kv
heads need 12 (48 q heads) to split by 6.

1. **Padded model dirs, on every box**, as step 1 above but with the drafter
   padded for 6:

       ... /tp3/make_padded.py SRC_MODEL DST_MODEL SRC_DRAFT DST_DRAFT \
         --draft-heads 48 --draft-kv-heads 12 --tp 6

2. **compose/.env on every box**: `MODEL_HOST_DIR` / `DFLASH_HOST_DIR` at the
   padded dirs, as for TP=3.

3. **Start** with the TP=3 command, `tp6.yaml` in place of `tp3.yaml`. It sets
   `TP=6` and its own snapshot tag (`tp6pad-...`).

The entrypoint's `TP=6` case sets the TP=4 KV pin (26 GiB; weights are ~1/6
per rank), block size 1792, `MAX_NUM_SEQS` 64 with RecoverSSM and the
adaptive-k starting cost. With 11 KDA heads per rank the mamba page is ~1573
tokens of attention page: the default 2304 pads it 46%, 1792 (the smallest
multiple of 256 above it) 14%, for a 1.7% bigger pool (4.47M tokens) and a
faster cached TTFT (0.677 against 0.903 s).

Tried and not kept at TP=6 (screened on an earlier build): sequence parallel off (-25% prefill),
`max_num_batched_tokens` 32768 (no prefill gain, and it needs a bigger arxbig
slot), `VLLM_MEGAMOE_MAX_TOKENS=16` (within noise).

`dev/patch-tests/_glm53_tp3_sparse_mla_test.py` includes H=11.

Measured on six boxes (one 200G switch, both ConnectX ports, GPU clocks locked
at 1989 MHz), booted clean with the entrypoint defaults on this branch's TP=6
changes over main 3df22b8 plus the padded-config import guard (#24):

| | |
|---|---|
| RigMark prose / code / structured, tok/s | 66.5 / 120.3 / 176.4 |
| RigMark cold prefill 8k / 32k / 64k, tok/s | 4776 / 4902 / 4903 |
| `gate/prefill.py` cold 32k / 128k, tok/s (2 seeds) | 4900, 4914 / 4737, 4724 |
| `gate/conc_workload.py code` 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 streams, tok/s | 145.0 / 153.8 / 218.6 / 281.7 |
| `conc_workload.py mixed` 8 / 16 / 32 / 48 / 64 streams, tok/s | 196.6 / 298.7 / 415.3 / 506.7 / 596.5 |
| `dev/repro/needle.py` 32k to 480k | 12/12 |

A 30-minute soak at 64 mixed streams (2700 requests) had no errors,
preemptions or restarts.

## On cables, with no switch

Three boxes with one cable per pair also form a ring. `TP=RING3` sets it up:
subnet-aware NCCL routing, arx in ring mode (`VLLM_ARX_RING=1`) with arxbig
off, since arxbig's ring does not take three ranks
([experimental/README.md](../README.md)). The section below has the start
command; the RING3 section above has the fabric layout.

Through a switch, with both neighbours on one port, ring and mesh at three
ranks gave the same bits and the same all-reduce latency: 14.5 / 21.5 / 45.7 /
72.9 us in ring mode against 13.6 / 24.2 / 44.9 / 72.6 in mesh mode, at
8 / 64 / 256 / 512 KB.

@calvarado2004 measured a cabled triangle on 45b438b, with every overlay and
RecoverSSM off, from their own launcher with the `TP=3` case's arguments and on
their own harness, so these aren't comparable with the main README's table
([#52](https://github.com/kindlingai/glm-5.3-flash-gx10/issues/52)):

- arx took decode from 116.2 / 88.9 / 47.6 to 128.9 / 94.5 / 49.1 tok/s
  (count / code / prose) and cold prefill at 21.9k from 2,503 to 2,938 tok/s.
- With `--max-model-len 1048576` at the 12 GiB pin the KV pool held 1,849,306
  tokens, and needles at 291,517, 600,405 and 955,301 tokens were found in
  104, 236 and 422 s.
- The first boot took 753 s and later boots 184-204 s; `smoketest/run.sh`
  passed 8/8.

### RING3 start command (measured 2026-09-30)

`compose/.env` on every box:

    TP=RING3
    HEAD_HOST=<head LAN address>
    VLLM_GLM_ARX_PREFETCH=0      # arx is not mounted at 3 ranks (the entrypoint also defaults this for RING3)

Then, on every box:

    docker compose -f compose/glm53.yaml -f experimental/compose/snapshot.yaml \
      -f experimental/compose/adaptive-k.yaml -f experimental/compose/fp8.yaml \
      -f experimental/compose/megamoe.yaml -f experimental/compose/fixes.yaml \
      -f experimental/compose/sp.yaml -f experimental/compose/recoverssm.yaml \
      -f experimental/compose/tp3.yaml up -d
